# README

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for cloning a repository from GitHub, installing necessary packages using npm, and running the code using npm start.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Git: [Download and Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Node.js: [Download and Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Clone the Repository

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Change the current working directory to the location where you want to clone the repository.
3. Execute the following command to clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/kashiph001/unravel-app.git
```

4. Press Enter to execute the command.
5. Wait for the cloning process to complete.

## Install Dependencies

1. Navigate to the cloned repository's directory:

```shell
cd repository
```

Replace `repository` with the actual name of the cloned repository.

2. Run the following command to install the necessary packages using npm:

```shell
npm install
```

This command will download and install all the required dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.

## Run the Code

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the code using the following command:

```shell
npm start
```

This command will execute the start script defined in the `package.json` file. It typically starts the application or runs the code.
